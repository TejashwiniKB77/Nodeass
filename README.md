Static Image Serving API
This assignment extends an existing Node.js and Express backend by adding a Static Image Serving API. The API enables clients to retrieve image files stored on the server using HTTP requests. It follows RESTful principles and ensures secure file handling, correct response headers, and proper error handling.

Objectives
Extend an existing Node.js + Express project
Serve static image files via an API
Maintain existing middleware and configuration
Handle invalid and missing image requests securely
Test functionality using browser and Postman

Image Storage Images are stored in a dedicated /images directory. A minimum of 10 image files are included. Supported formats include JPG, JPEG, and PNG.

API Endpoint Details -GET /images/:imageName

Sample Requests Browser: http://localhost:5000/images/image1.jpg

Postman: GET http://localhost:5000/images/image5.png

Missing Image: http://localhost:5000/images/unknown.jpg

Security Measures

Prevents directory traversal attacks
Validates file existence before response
Rejects invalid file names
Execution Steps

Navigate to backend folder
Run npm install
Start server using node server.js
Access API using browser or Postman
Conclusion The Static Image Serving API has been successfully implemented and tested. The project meets all assignment requirements and follows best practices.
